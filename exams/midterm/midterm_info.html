<h4>Material Coverage</h4>
The midterm will test material covered since the beginning of the semester until the
week of 10-18 (inclusive) -- everything we have done in class (readings, lectures, labs,
homeworks) up through, and including, the Twitter talk, except what was covered in discussion.

<h4>Administration</h4>
The midterm will be administered in <em>two parts</em> on <strong>Wednesday 10-27</strong>.
The first part will be administered at
<a href="http://berkeley.edu/map/maps/AB45.html"
style="text-decoration: none;"><strong>200 Sutardja Dai</strong></a> in the
<strong>second hour of the lab section that you regularly attend</strong>.  For example, if you
attend the 12pm to 2pm section, the first part of your midterm will be administered from 1pm to
2pm.  The first part of the midterm will be done on the computer: you will each sit one computer
per student, and we will ask you to download files and instructions off of a certain location.
You will submit your final answers on <a href="http://bspace.berkeley.edu"
style="text-decoration: none;">bSpace</a>.

<br/><br/>

The second part will be administered at <a href="http://berkeley.edu/map/maps/BC45.html"
style="text-decoration: none;"><strong>10 Evans</strong></a> from <strong>6pm to 8pm</strong>.
It will be done on paper, and we will provide a list of the blocks available in Scratch and BYOB
that you can use.  The style of this part of the midterm will be similar to that of the Quest:
we will ask you questions on the readings, on various concepts, and on programming in BYOB.
You are allowed <strong>two study sheets</strong> of size 8.5" x 11", handwritten on both
sides.

<br/><br/>

Please let the staff know if you have a legitimate conflict with the times of the midterm
administrations so that we can make alternate arrangements.  Please let us know <em>as soon
as possible</em>; we cannot help you if you inform us the day before the midterm.

<h4>Review Session</h4>
There will be a review session for the midterm, from <strong>6pm to 9pm</strong> on
<strong>Sunday 10-24</strong>, at the <a href="http://berkeley.edu/map/maps/AB45.html"
style="text-decoration: none;"><strong>Wozniak Lounge in Soda</strong></a>.  The presentation
from the review session is available <a href="http://bit.ly/a3YV0Q"
style="text-decoration: none;">here</a>.

<h4>Preparation</h4>
First off, don't panic!  Drink some chamomile tea, take a deep breath, and maybe even
<a href="http://www.gocomics.com/foxtrot/2010/01/24" style="text-decoration: none;">read this
comic strip</a>.  Work through the labs and homeworks once again, and ask questions if anything
is unclear.  We have also posted the <a href="fa09" style="text-decoration: none;">midterm</a>
from the last administration of this class in Fall 2009; you may find this useful to get a sense
of how the midterm will be structured and what may be on it.
