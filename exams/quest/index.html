    <center><h1>CS10 Quest Information</h1></center>

    <h2>General Information</h2>

<p>The high-order bit is that <i>the quest is only worth 5% of your
grade</i>, so don't get too stressed about the exam. We're going
to be aiming the difficulty of the exam relatively low, so if you've
been coming to class and lab, and doing your homework and readings,
you should do quite well.</p>

    <p>The quest will be taking place on Monday, February 14, 2011 <b>in lecture</b>.  It will be entirely paper-based 
and no laptops will be allowed.  Anything we've done in class or in the readings (except discussions, these vary by TA and are meant for reinforcement of existing content and addressing student questions) is fair game.  We usually divide the course (and exam) into two sections:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Big Ideas of Computing</b>
      <ul>
    <li>Lecture topics</li>
    <li>Weekly readings</li>
    </ul>
      <li><b>Programming Concepts</b>
      <ul>
    <li>Lab work</li>
    <li>Homeworks</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
    <p>Approximately half of the points will be from <b>Big Ideas of Computing</b>, and these will most likely be fill-in-the-blank or short 
response.  The other half of the exam will be <b>Programming Concepts</b>, and these will involve debugging short blocks 
of code, identifying what a provided block or algorithm does, or similar exercises.</p>

    <p><i>Do not worry about the "memoized" section of the algorithms lab.</i>  (This was provided as a critical thinking 
exercise but it isn't necessary to understand it to do well on the quest.)</p>

<h2>What you're allowed to bring to the exam</h2>

Pencils. You will not need a blue book; you'll write in the blanks on the exam paper we'll provide. The exam is closed book, except for one handwritten (double-sided) "study sheet" of paper. On the upcoming midterm, you'll be able to bring two sheets, and on the final, three. All have to be handwritten.

    <h2>How to Study</h2>

    <p>The three best ways to study are to review the materials we've
    been over (labs, readings, lectures, homework), to attend the review session
    (below), and to review the Fall 2010 quest:

<ul>
<li><a href="2010FaCS10Quest.pdf">quest</a>
<li><a href="2010FaCS10QuestSolutions.pdf">answers</a>
<li><a href="WritingScratchBYOBCodeOnPaper.pdf">(extra) <i>Writing Scratch/BYOB code on paper</i> document</a>
<li><a href="http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs10/sp11/lab/solutions.html">Lab &amp; Homework Solutions</a></li>
<li><a href="http://bit.ly/cs10-sp11-quest">Review slides</a></li>
<li><a href="http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs10/sp11/exams/quest/review/">Some 
review materials from discussion</a></li>
</ul>

The 
quest will be similar in scope to last semester's version, and the topics and 
readings for 
both versions of the course should be similar enough that the actual questions should be answerable for you in most 
cases.  Reviewing homework exercises are also a good idea in order to reinforce lab concepts.</p>
    
    <b>We always encourage students to form study teams, feel free to use Piazzza to organize that based on living group or interest or lab...</b>

<h2>Review Session</h2>

There will be a review session on Sunday, February 13th, 2011 from 3-6pm in the Wozniak Lounge (where we had the kickoff party), rooms 430 through 438 Soda Hall.
